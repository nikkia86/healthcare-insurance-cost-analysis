        "The summary statistics give an initial understanding of the key numerical variables in the dataset. The mean reflects the average value, while the median identifies the midpoint of the data and is particularly helpful when distributions are skewed. The standard deviation indicates how much the values vary around the mean, highlighting the level of spread within each variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The average age is roughly 39, with a range from 18 to 64, showing that the dataset mainly represents adults of working age. The standard deviation suggests a moderate spread in ages. The mean BMI is just above 30, placing the average individual in the overweight category, and the wide range (around 16 to 53) shows substantial variation that may influence insurance charges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The median number of children is 1, indicating that most individuals have either no children or one child, with values ranging from 0 to 5. Insurance charges display the greatest variability. Although the mean is around 13,000, the maximum exceeds 63,000, suggesting a right skewed distribution where a small number of individuals incur significantly higher medical costs.\n",
